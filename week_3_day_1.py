song = "Promise" #string variable

print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " year old coder named " + name + ".") 

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
print("Itzel liked to hum the song " + song + " while coding. It was so annoying that their teamates would throw " + food + " until " + name + " would stop singing.")
